# Wsh
the Widget Shell

## Why?
because sometimes I want to run a quick command. Now, when you want to do that, you have to either
1. Launch Terminal.app and wait for it to open (Not ridiculous, but it takes longer than the original command you wanted to run)
2. Keep Terminal.app running all the time. Ehh
